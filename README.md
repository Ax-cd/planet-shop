This project is based on a tutorial found on Youtube - credits are given below.
It is a landing page build with HTML and Sass for a fictional company, "ThePlanetShop", that specializes in selling planets.

## Description

The point of focus when I took this project was to get use to writing SASS, mainly organizing and linking the files so the entire project would work. The feature I like most is the animation I implemented for the image.

The project was built with:

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- CSS Grid

And tested with:

- The Colour Contrast Analyser (CCA)
- The web accessibility evaluation tool (WAVE)
- The Markup Validation Service of W3C
